## Full Documentation

See the full documentation over at the [project's Github Pages](https://grapoza.github.io/vue-tree/). This includes information on how to use and configure the tree view, features (both existing and planned) as well as some demos.

##  Installation

Install the component with your favorite package manager:
```shell
yarn add @grapoza/vue-tree
```
or
```shell
npm install --save @grapoza/vue-tree
```

The default import from this package is the components from the .vue files. In addition to this, pre-compiled versions of the Tree View component and CSS are also available in the package but you will need to reference them manually from your own project.

## Usage

If you're using it in a .vue file:

```html
<template>
  <tree-view  id="my-tree" :initial-model="dataModel"></tree-view>
</template>

// Options API
<script>
import { TreeView } from "@grapoza/vue-tree"

export default {
  components: {
    TreeView
  },
  data() {
    return {
      dataModel: [
        {
          id: "numberOrString",
          label: "Root Node",
          children: [
            {id: 1, label: "Child Node"},
            {id: "node2", label: "Second Child"}
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
</script>

// Composition API
<script setup>
import { TreeView } from "@grapoza/vue-tree"
const dataModel = ref([
  {
    id: "numberOrString",
    label: "Root Node",
    children: [
      {id: 1, label: "Child Node"},
      {id: "node2", label: "Second Child"}
    ]
  }
])
</script>
```

Or, import it into your application:

```javascript
import { TreeView } from "@grapoza/vue-tree"
Vue.use(TreeView)
```
Then add the component:
```html
<tree-view id="my-tree" :initial-model="dataModel"></tree-view>
```
```javascript
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      dataModel: [
        {id: "numberOrString", label: "Root Node", children: [
          {id: 1, label: "Child Node"},
          {id: "node2", label: "Second Child"}]
        }]
    }
  }
}
```
