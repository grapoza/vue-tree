vue-tree is a Vue component that implements a Tree View control. Its aim is to provide common tree options in a way that is easy to use and easy to customize.

> ⚠️**From version 4.0.0 this component only works with Vue 3 and up. For Vue 2 support, use [version 3.x](https://grapoza.github.io/vue-tree/3.0.4/).**

Features include:

- Expandable nodes
- Checkboxes
- Radio buttons
- Node selection
- Addition and removal of nodes
- Slots for node content
- Skinning
- Asynchronous loading of nodes
- Follows ARIA guidelines for treeview accessibility
- Drag and drop (single nodes, works between trees)

For future plans, see the project's [Issues](https://github.com/grapoza/vue-tree/issues) page.

##  Installation

Install the component with your favorite package manager:
```shell
yarn add @grapoza/vue-tree
```
or
```shell
npm install --save @grapoza/vue-tree
```

## Usage

If you're using it in a .vue file:

```html
<template>
  <tree-view  id="my-tree" :initial-model="dataModel"></tree-view>
</template>

// Options API
<script>
import { TreeView } from "@grapoza/vue-tree"

export default {
  components: {
    TreeView
  },
  data() {
    return {
      dataModel: [
        {
          id: "numberOrString",
          label: "Root Node",
          children: [
            {id: 1, label: "Child Node"},
            {id: "node2", label: "Second Child"}
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
</script>

// Composition API
<script setup>
import { TreeView } from "@grapoza/vue-tree"
const dataModel = ref([
  {
    id: "numberOrString",
    label: "Root Node",
    children: [
      {id: 1, label: "Child Node"},
      {id: "node2", label: "Second Child"}
    ]
  }
])
</script>
```

Or, import it into your application:

```javascript
import { TreeView } from "@grapoza/vue-tree"
Vue.use(TreeView)
```
Then add the component:
```html
<tree-view id="my-tree" :initial-model="dataModel"></tree-view>
```
```javascript
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      dataModel: [
        {
          id: "numberOrString",
          label: "Root Node",
          children: [
            {id: 1, label: "Child Node"},
            {id: "node2", label: "Second Child"}
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Tree Props

| Prop              | Type     | Description                                                                                        | Default value                     | Required |
|:------------------|:---------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------|:---------|
| initialModel      | Array    | The data model containing [model data](#model-data)                                                | `[]`                              |          |
| customAriaKeyMap  | Object   | An object, the properties of which are arrays to keyCodes for various actions                      | See [Aria](#setting-key-bindings) |          |
| loadNodesAsync    | Function | A function that is called on mount to asynchronously load [model data](#model-data)                | `null`                            |          |
| modelDefaults     | Object   | An object containing defaults for all nodes that do not specify the given properties               | `{}`                              |          |
| selectionMode     | String   | How selection should operate (see [Selection Mode](#selection-mode))                               | `null` (cannot select nodes)      |          |
| skinClass         | String   | A class name to apply to the tree that specifies a skin to use (see [Skins](#skins))               | `"grtv-default-skin"`             |          |

## Selection Mode

The `selectionMode` property defines how nodes should be selected within the tree view. Allowed values are `null`, `single`, `selectionFollowsFocus`, and `multiple`. Only nodes with the `selectable` model property set to `true` can be selected.

- If `null` (the default) then selection does not occur.
- If `single` then one node is selected at a time when the user clicks the node or using the selection keyboard binding (`Enter` by default).
- If `selectionFollowsFocus` then selection follows the focusable node within the tree view.
- if `multiple` then multiple nodes can be selected when the user clicks each node or using the selection keyboard binding on each node.

When clicking on a node, it is only selected if the click target was not interactive (_e.g._, clicking a checkbox or expander won't select the node, but clicking a label will).

## Model Data

Model data can be loaded either synchronously through the `initialModel` property or asynchronously through the `loadNodesAsync` property. If both are specified then the data from `initialModel` is overwritten when the `loadNodesAsync` function returns data.

The data passed to the tree view's `initialModel` prop or returned from `loadNodesAsync` should be an array of nodes, where each node should have:

* Required: A property with a value that will be used as the node's ID (by default the node looks for a property named `id`)
* Required: A property with a value that will be used as the node's label (by default the node looks for a property named `label`)
* Optional: A property containing any subnodes (by default the node looks for a property named `children`)
* Optional: A `treeNodeSpec` property that contains any data about the node's capabilities and its initial state
* Optional: Any other data you want on your node

The `treeNodeSpec` of the objects in the data model passed to the tree view's `initialModel` property will be updated by the tree view nodes themselves on creation to include missing properties.

```javascript
{
  id: "node0",
  label: "A checkbox node",
  children: [],
  treeNodeSpec: {
    title: "This will be the value of the node text/label's 'title' attribute.",
    expandable: true,
    selectable: false,
    focusable: true,
    input: {
      type: 'checkbox'
    },
    state: {
      expanded: true,
      selected: false,
      input: {
        value: false,
        disabled: false
      }
    }
  }
},
{
  otherIdProp: "node1",
  textProp: "A radio button node",
  subThings: [],
  extraIrrelevantData: "February",
  treeNodeSpec: {
    idProperty: "otherIdProp", // Customize what model props are checked for the id, label, and children
    labelProperty: "textProp",
    childrenProperty: "subThings",
    expandable: true,
    selectable: false,
    input: {
      type: 'radio',
      name: 'rbGroup1',   // Used as the name attribute for the radio button
      value: 'thisValue', // Used as the value attribute for the radio button
      isInitialRadioGroupValue: true // Indicates this should be the initially selected value for the group
    },
    state: {
      expanded: true,
      selected: false
      // No input.value here; to let complex radio button groupings work, state value is
      // bound to an internal tree-level property. input.disabled, however, is valid here for radio buttons.
    },
    addChildCallback: () => Promise.resolve({ id: '1', label: 'label' })
  }
}
```

The properties below can be specified for each node. Note that `id`, `label`, and `children` are the default properties nodes look for to get data, but the names of the properties can be overridden using the `treeNodeSpec`.

| Prop                 | Type            | Description                                                                | Default value                      | Required |
|:---------------------|:----------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|:---------|
| id                   | Number/String   | An ID that uniquely identifies this node within the tree                   | -                                  | Yes      |
| label                | String          | The text to show in the tree view                                          | -                                  | Yes      |
| children             | Array<Object\>  | The child nodes of this node                                               | `[]`                               |          |
| treeNodeSpec         | Object          | The object containing data about the node's capabilities and initial state | See next table                     |          |

The `treeNodeSpec` property contains any data about the node's capabilities and its initial state. This keeps the tree-specific data separate from the data of the model itself. This makes it more convenient to drop data into the tree view as-is, potentially with a `modelDefaults` specified on the tree view to define common values used in the `treeNodeSpec` of every node.

\*\* If `input.value` is not supplied, it defaults to the node's label value replaced with the regular expression `/[\s&<>"'\/]/g, ''`

## Default Data

If specified, the `modelDefaults` property of the TreeView will be merged with node model's `treeNodeSpec` data such that any data not explicitly specified for the node will be set to the value from `modelDefaults`. This is useful for situations where all (or most) nodes will use the same values. For instance, in a tree view that is all enabled, collapsed, unchecked checkboxes the user could use a `modelDefaults` of

```javascript
{
  expandable: true,
  selectable: true,
  input: {
    type: 'checkbox',
  },
  state: {
    expanded: false,
    selected: false,
    input: {
      value: false,
      disabled: false
    }
  }
}
```

## CSS Classes

The display of the tree view can be customized via CSS using the following classes. Class names are organized in a hierarchy, so a containing node's class is the prefix of its child classes.

| Class                                  | Affects                                                                          |

## Customizing the Tree View

### Customizations Property

It's often helpful to be able to make adjustments to the markup or styles for the tree. You can provide an object to the `modelDefaults.customizations` property of the tree to set a customization affecting all nodes, or to the `treeNodeSpec.customizations` property of a single node. Node-specific customizations will override `modelDefault` customizations.

A customizations object may have the following properties:

| Prop                                      | Type   | Description                                                                                  |
|:------------------------------------------|:-------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| classes                                   | Object | Properties are classes to add for various parts of a node                                    |

### Skins

If adding classes isn't enough, the entire default styles of the TreeView can be overridden using the `skinClass` property of the TreeView. When this property is set, the TreeView's default class of `grtv-default-skin` is replaced with your own class name, causing all of the built-in style selectors to not match the tree. Instead, you can create your own stylesheet or modify a copy of the default styles to achieve complete control over the tree styling.

### Slots

Sometimes the entire content of a node (_e.g._, the checkbox or text) needs customization beyond what is available through classes. In this case, some slots are available in the TreeView to allow this customization.

| Slot Name    | Description                                                 | Props                                                                                              |

Example usage:

```html
<tree-view id="customtree" :initial-model="model">
  <template #text="{ model, customClasses }">
    <!-- The TreeViewNode's model is available, and built-in classes and overrides are available -->
    <em :title="model.treeNodeSpec.title"
              class="grtvn-self-text"
              :class="customClasses.treeViewNodeSelfText">
          {{ model[model.treeNodeSpec.labelProperty] }}
    </em>
  </template>

  <template #checkbox="{ model, customClasses, inputId, checkboxChangeHandler }">
    <label :for="inputId"
        :title="model.treeNodeSpec.title"
        class="grtvn-self-label"
        :class="customClasses.treeViewNodeSelfLabel">

      <!-- The generated inputId for the node is available -->
      <input :id="inputId"
             class="my-awesome-checkbox-class"
             type="checkbox"
             :disabled="model.treeNodeSpec.state.input.disabled"
             v-model="model.treeNodeSpec.state.input.value"
             @change="checkboxChangeHandler" /> <!-- The TreeViewNode change handler is available -->

      <em>{{ "Slotted Content for " + model[model.treeNodeSpec.labelProperty] }}</em>
    </label>
  </template>
</tree-view>
```

## Asynchronous Loading

Child nodes can be loaded asynchronously by providing a method to the `treeNodeSpec.loadChildrenAsync` property of the model. The method will be called when the node is expanded, and the property containing the node's children will be _overwritten_ with the results of the async call. For example, the following could be used as `modelDefaults` that would have every node load children when it was expanded.

```javascript
{
  expandable: true,
  loadChildrenAsync: (m) => axios.get(`/children/${m.id}`)
}
```

The method may accept one argument, which will be the model of the node that has been expanded. It should resolve to an array of child node models.

The load method is called once, and after that the children are part of the model and are not reloaded.

## Drag and Drop

A user can drag and drop an individual TreeViewNode. A drag only affects the node where the dragging starts, and has nothing to do with any node selection within the tree. To make a node draggable, the node's `treeNodeSpec.draggable` must be `true`. To make a node accept drops, the node's `treeNodeSpec.allowDrop` must be `true`. Both Move and Copy operations are supported. To copy in most browsers hold down the `Ctrl` key while dragging.

When dropping a node on another node, there are three areas of the target node where a drop can occur. If dropped at the top of the target node in the shaded area then the node will be inserted before the target. If dropped at the bottom of the target node in the shaded area then the node will be inserted after the target. If dropped directly on the of the target node then the node will be inserted as a child of the target. The drop can occur on a node in the same tree or in a different tree as long as the receiving node allows drops.

The drop can also occur anywhere that allows dropping data with the `application/json` or `text/plain` MIME types (_e.g._, a simple text input field or a text editor).

When copying a node the newly created node will have its own unique identifier, will not be the currently focusable node even if the source node was the focusable node.

When moving a node within the same tree, the actual node is moved within the tree data. If the node is copied within the same tree, any function members of the node data (_e.g._, the addChildCallback) are copied.

When a node is moved or copied to a different tree, the node data that passes between trees does not contain any of the functions from the original node data.

## Aria

ARIA Accessibility recommendations have been implemented at a basic level. This means keyboard navigation follows ARIA recommendations, but the component has not been tested with a screen reader and, since many screen readers exhibit different behaviors for tree view controls anyway, it would be expected to fail articulation checks in many cases. Additionally, some recommended keyboard controls are not implemented (e.g., Expand All Nodes, Type-ahead Focusing). When using the component, there are only a couple of things you need to know.

### Setting Key Bindings

The keys used to navigate the tree view can be customized using the `customAriaKeyMap` prop of the TreeView component. The value of the prop is an object, with each attribute named for a type of action and its value as an Array of integer key codes that trigger that action.

| Attribute           | Description                                                                                            | Default value            |
|:--------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------|
| activateItem        | Triggers the default action for input nodes (generally `click`)                                        | `[32]` (Space)           |

| focusLastItem       | Sets focus to the last visible item in the tree                                                        | `[35]` (End)             |
| focusFirstItem      | Sets focus to the first visible item in the tree                                                       | `[36]` (Home)            |
| collapseFocusedItem | Collapses the currently focused item, if expanded; otherwise focuses the parent node if one exists     | `[37]` (Left)            |

\* The previous visible node is a)the focused node's previous sibling's last child if visible, b)the previous sibling if it has no children or is collapsed, or c)the parent node.

\*\* The next visible node is a)the focused node's first child if one exists and the focused node is expanded, b)the focused node's next sibling if one exists, or c)the focused node's parent's next sibling if one exists.

### Focusable

The tree view uses a roaming tab index to maintain focusability in the tree. A node model can specify a `treeNodeSpec.focusable` property of `true` in order for that node to be used as the initial target of keyboard focus within the tree view. If multiple node models specify this then only the first will have `treeNodeSpec.focusable` set to `true` once the tree view is intialized. If no models have it specified then the first selected node in the tree view is given a `treeNodeSpec.focusable` of `true`. If there are no selected nodes then the first node in the tree view is given a `treeNodeSpec.focusable` of `true`.
