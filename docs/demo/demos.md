## Demos

Two basic demos are currently available. These will be expanded as time allows, though PRs are always welcome. Demos always run with the latest released version of the component.

Note that demos probably (definitely) won't work in IE due to the way the component is loaded.

- [Basic Checkbox Usage](basic.html)
- [Basic Radio Button Usage](radioBasic.html)
- [Adding and Removing Nodes](addRemove.html)
- [Slots](slots.html)
